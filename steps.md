## 📋 **NEXT STEPS (Priority Order)**

### **🔥 HIGH PRIORITY**

#### **1. Language Feature Enhancement** 🚀
**Status:** 🔄 **IN PROGRESS**  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Based on:** Proven old implementation patterns

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Study old implementation thoroughly for best practices
- [ ] Enhance frontend parser based on old patterns
- [ ] Add more language features from old implementation
- [ ] Improve error handling and diagnostics
- [ ] Add support for more Razen-specific constructs

#### **2. Professional CLI Tool** 🛠️
**Status:** Not Started  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 days

**Goal:** Create professional `razen` command-line tool

**Commands to Implement:**
```bash
razen run program.rzn          # JIT compile and run
razen dev program.rzn          # Development mode
razen compile program.rzn      # AOT compile to executable
razen test program.rzn         # Run test file
razen help                     # Show help
```

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create clean CLI interface
- [ ] Implement command parsing
- [ ] Add proper error messages and help text
- [ ] Professional user experience

### **🔶 MEDIUM PRIORITY**

#### **3. Documentation & Examples** 📚
**Status:** Minimal  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 days

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create comprehensive README.md
- [ ] Language specification document
- [ ] Tutorial and getting started guide
- [ ] Example programs showcase
- [ ] Architecture documentation

#### **4. Advanced Language Features** 🚀
**Status:** Not Started  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Based on:** Old implementation patterns

**Features to Add:**
- [ ] More control flow constructs
- [ ] Advanced data types
- [ ] Library system integration
- [ ] Error handling improvements
- [ ] Performance optimizations

## 🎯 **IMMEDIATE NEXT TASK**

**Current:** ✅ **Professional Backend Redesign COMPLETED**

**Next Recommended:** **Language Feature Enhancement** (#1)

**Rationale:**
- ✅ Clean, professional backend built from scratch
- 🎯 Need to study old implementation for best practices
- 🔥 Critical for adding more language features
- 📚 Based on proven old implementation patterns

**Command to test current functionality:**
```bash
# Test current clean implementation
cargo run -- run test_simple.rzn --clean-output
cargo run -- run test_complex.rzn --clean-output
```

## 📊 **PROJECT METRICS**

### **Current Codebase:**
- **Dependencies:** 0 (zero external dependencies)
- **Backend:** Clean, professional, from-scratch implementation
- **Architecture:** Simple, maintainable, maximum control
- **Code Quality:** Professional standards, no emojis
- **Warnings:** 0 (clean codebase)

### **Performance:**
- **Compilation:** Fast, clean execution
- **Memory Usage:** Minimal, efficient
- **Execution:** Silent like `go run`
