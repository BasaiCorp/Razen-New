**Missing from Native (9 operations):**

- [ ] Label (needs address mapping)
- [ ] Return (needs stack frame management)
- [ ] Call (user functions - needs calling convention)
- [ ] MethodCall (needs object system)
- [ ] DefineFunction (needs function table)
- [ ] Print/ReadInput/Exit (I/O operations)
- [ ] CreateMap/GetKey/SetKey (needs hash table)

### Bytecode Support (Fast Interpreter)
**Supported: 47 operations (100%)**

#### All Native Operations (33) PLUS:

**Control Flow (NEW - 7 operations):**
- [x] Jump (unconditional jump)
- [x] JumpIfFalse (conditional jump)
- [x] JumpIfTrue (conditional jump)
- [x] Label (jump target marker)
- [x] Return (function return)
- [x] DefineFunction (function definition)
- [x] MethodCall (method invocation)

**Other Operations:**
- [x] CreateArray/GetIndex/SetIndex
- [x] ToInt/ToFloat/ToString/ToBool
- [x] Typeof/Length

**Bytecode with Runtime Fallback (7 operations):**
- [x] Print/PrintLn (falls back to runtime for I/O)
- [x] ReadInput (falls back to runtime)
- [x] Exit (falls back to runtime)
- [x] CreateMap/GetKey/SetKey (falls back to runtime)
- [x] Call (user functions - falls back to runtime)
- [x] Sleep (falls back to runtime)
- [x] LibraryCall (falls back to runtime)

---

### Runtime Support (Complete - 100%)
**Supported: 47 operations (100%)**

All operations are fully supported in runtime execution.

## Performance Characteristics

### Execution Speed (Relative)
1. **Native JIT**: 10-50x faster (direct machine code)
2. **Bytecode**: 3-10x faster (optimized interpreter)
3. **Runtime**: 1x baseline (full feature support)

### Current Strategy Triggers

```rust
Native:   arithmetic_ops > 15 && complex < 3 && ratio > 0.7
Bytecode: ir.len() > 8 && arithmetic > 2 && complexity < 10
Runtime:  complex_ops > 5 || control_flow > 3 || default
```

## Recommendations for Speed Optimization

### High Priority (Easy Wins)
1. **Add Power to Native** - Simple floating-point operation
2. **Add FloorDiv to Native** - Division + floor operation
3. **Improve Variable Operations** - Better register allocation in Native

### Medium Priority
4. **Add Jump/Label to Native** - Requires label resolution pass
5. **Add Return to Native** - Stack frame management
6. **String Pool for Native** - Intern strings for PushString support

### Low Priority (Complex)
7. **Function Calls in Native** - Requires calling convention
8. **Array Operations in Native** - Memory management needed

## Current Coverage Summary

| Execution Mode | Operations Supported | Percentage | Speed |
|---------------|---------------------|------------|-------|
| Native JIT    | 33/47              | 70.2%      | Fastest (10-50x) |
| Bytecode      | 47/47              | 100%       | Fast (3-10x) |
| Runtime       | 47/47              | 100%       | Baseline (1x) |

**Fastest Path Coverage: 70.2%** - Most arithmetic/logic/variable operations use native code
**Bytecode Coverage: 100%** - All operations supported with smart runtime fallback
**Safe Fallback: 100%** - All operations guaranteed to work via runtime
