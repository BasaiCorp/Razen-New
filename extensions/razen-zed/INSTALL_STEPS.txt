RAZEN ZED EXTENSION - INSTALLATION STEPS
=========================================

The grammar is now fixed and working! Follow these steps:

1. OPEN ZED:
   $ zed

2. INSTALL EXTENSION:
   - Press: Ctrl+Shift+P (or Cmd+Shift+P on Mac)
   - Type: "install dev extension"
   - Select: /home/prathmeshbro/Desktop/razen project/razen-lang-new/extensions/razen-zed
   - Click: Open

3. VERIFY:
   - Check if "Razen" appears in Extensions list
   - No errors should appear

4. TEST:
   - Open: simple.rzn (in the razen-zed folder)
   - You should see syntax highlighting!

5. IF IT STILL FAILS:
   - Check Zed logs: Ctrl+Shift+P â†’ "Open Log"
   - Look for "razen" errors
   - Share the error message

WHAT WAS FIXED:
- Changed extension.toml to use local grammar path
- Grammar files are generated in tree-sitter-razen/src/
- Parser is working (tested with bunx tree-sitter parse)

TRY IT NOW!
