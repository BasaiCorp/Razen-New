# RAJIT JIT Compiler Improvement Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a systematic approach to improve the RAJIT JIT compiler implementation. The current implementation shows ambitious architectural design but suffers from incomplete features, over-engineering, and unvalidated performance claims. This plan addresses these issues through a phased approach focusing on correctness, completeness, and performance validation.

## Current State Analysis

### Critical Issues Identified

1. **Incomplete Implementation**
   - Native cache execution is non-functional
   - Complex IR operations fall back to NOPs
   - Many optimization passes are disabled
   - Bytecode execution skips most operations

2. **Over-Engineering**
   - 1648 lines of complex code with limited functionality
   - Multiple unused optimization levels
   - Excessive debug output affecting performance
   - Redundant code paths

3. **Performance Claims vs Reality**
   - Unsubstantiated performance claims
   - No benchmarking or validation
   - Theoretical optimizations without measurement
   - Limited actual native compilation

4. **Code Quality**
   - Excessive dead code with allow annotations
   - Inconsistent error handling
   - Complex state management
   - Poor maintainability
