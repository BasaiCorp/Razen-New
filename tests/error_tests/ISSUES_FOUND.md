# Diagnostic and Error Reporting Issues Found

## Summary
Testing revealed several issues with error reporting and type checking in the Razen language compiler.

## Critical Issues

### 1. **Type Annotation Reassignment Not Checked** ❌ CRITICAL
**File:** `02_type_mismatch.rzn`
**Issue:** When a variable has a type annotation, reassignments to incompatible types are NOT caught at compile time.

**Example:**
```razen
var count: int = 10
count = "hello"  // Should error but doesn't!
count = 25.5     // Should error but doesn't!
```

**Current Behavior:** Only the initial assignment is type-checked. Subsequent reassignments bypass type checking.

**Expected Behavior:** Should report type mismatch errors for all reassignments to type-annotated variables.

**Impact:** HIGH - This defeats the purpose of type annotations and can cause runtime errors.

---

### 2. **Parser Fails on Type Names as Identifiers** ❌ CRITICAL
**File:** `03_undefined_function.rzn`, `08_type_annotation_errors.rzn`
**Issue:** Parser treats type names (`str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`) as keywords and fails when used as function names.

**Example:**
```razen
str(123)  // Parser error: "Expected expression"
int("456")  // Parser error: "Expected expression"
```

**Current Behavior:** Parser rejects these as syntax errors before semantic analysis.

**Expected Behavior:** Should parse successfully and report "undefined function" with helpful suggestions like "Did you mean `tostr`?"

**Impact:** HIGH - Users get confusing parse errors instead of helpful semantic errors.

---

### 3. **Generic Type Annotations Not Supported** ❌ MAJOR
**File:** `08_type_annotation_errors.rzn`
**Issue:** Generic type syntax like `array<int>` and `map<str, int>` causes parser errors.

**Example:**
```razen
var numbers: array<int> = [1, 2, 3]  // Parser error
var data: map<str, int> = {}  // Parser error
```

**Current Behavior:** Parser fails with "Expected expression" error.

**Expected Behavior:** Should either:
- Support generic type syntax, OR
- Use simpler syntax like `int[]` or `[int]`, OR
- Provide clear error message about unsupported syntax

**Impact:** MEDIUM - Documented feature doesn't work, confusing for users.

---

### 4. **Case-Sensitive Type Names Not Validated** ⚠️ MINOR
**File:** `08_type_annotation_errors.rzn`
**Issue:** Type names with wrong capitalization (Int, String, Bool) are not caught with helpful suggestions.

**Example:**
```razen
var count: Int = 10  // Should suggest 'int'
var name: String = "John"  // Should suggest 'str'
```

**Current Behavior:** Reports "cannot find type" but doesn't suggest the correct lowercase version.

**Expected Behavior:** Should detect case mismatch and suggest: "Did you mean `int`? Type names in Razen are lowercase."

**Impact:** LOW - But would improve user experience.

## Working Features ✅

### 1. **Undefined Variable Detection** ✅ EXCELLENT
- Detects undefined variables correctly
- Provides smart suggestions based on Levenshtein distance
- Detects case sensitivity issues
- Helpful error messages

### 2. **Undefined Function Detection** ✅ GOOD
- Detects undefined functions (when not blocked by parser issues)
- Would benefit from better suggestions for common mistakes

### 3. **Wrong Argument Count** ✅ EXCELLENT
- Accurately detects argument count mismatches
- Clear error messages showing expected vs actual
- Works for both user-defined and built-in functions

### 4. **Duplicate Definition Detection** ✅ GOOD
- Detects duplicate variable and function definitions
- Shows location of previous definition

### 5. **Break/Continue Outside Loop** ✅ GOOD
- Correctly detects misplaced break/continue statements
- Clear error messages

### 6. **Unused Variable Warnings** ✅ EXCELLENT
- Detects unused variables
- Suggests underscore prefix for intentionally unused variables

## Recommendations

### Priority 1 (Critical - Fix Immediately)
1. **Fix type annotation reassignment checking** - Add runtime type checking for annotated variables
2. **Fix parser to allow type names as identifiers** - Type names should only be keywords in type annotation context

### Priority 2 (Important - Fix Soon)
3. **Add generic type syntax support OR document limitations** - Either implement `array<T>` syntax or use simpler alternatives
4. **Improve type name suggestions** - Detect case mismatches and suggest corrections

### Priority 3 (Nice to Have)
5. **Add more function name suggestions** - Expand the list of common mistakes (str→tostr, int→toint, etc.)
6. **Add compile-time division by zero detection** - Warn about literal division by zero
7. **Add array bounds checking** - Warn about out-of-bounds access when indices are literals

## Conclusion

The Razen compiler has a **solid foundation** for error reporting with excellent diagnostics for undefined variables, argument count mismatches, and unused variables. However, there are **critical gaps** in type annotation enforcement and parser handling of type names that need immediate attention.

The diagnostic system itself (colors, formatting, suggestions) is **excellent** and provides a great user experience when it works correctly. The main issues are in the semantic analysis and parser, not the diagnostic display system.
